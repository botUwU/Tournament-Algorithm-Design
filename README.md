"# Tournament-Algorithm-Design"

TASKS: - Design an algorithm that simulates the full tournament. - Calculate its time complexity (ONo, O(n log n), O(nÂ²), etc.). - Optimize it: - Can you reduce unnecessary calculations? - Can you make it run faster without changing the rules? - Compete against other teams: - The most efficient and correct solution wins the coding challenge!
