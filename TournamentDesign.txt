|||||   RUNTIME AND COMPLEXITY    |||||


InitializeTeams() Complexity
The function generates n teams, each with a random strength.
The loop runs n times, appending teams to the list.
Time Complexity: O(n)



SimulateRound(teamList) Complexity
The function iterates through n teams in pairs (i.e., step size = 2).
This results in n/2 iterations in the first round.
Each round halves the number of teams, meaning we have log(n) rounds.
Time Complexity (for one round): O(n)
Total Rounds Complexity: O(n log n)


SimulateMatch(A, B) Complexity
The function only executes constant operations (random number generation and condition checks).
Time Complexity: O(1)



ChampionsLeague() Complexity
The main loop runs while Length(Teams) > 1, meaning log(n) rounds.
Each round calls SimulateRound(), which processes n teams in O(n).
Overall Complexity: O(n log n)
